# NBCOT OTR Blueprint Summary (2024)

These percentages are drawn from the current NBCOT OTR exam blueprint (effective 2024). The exam delivers 170 items (150 scored, 20 pretest). Each scored item is weighted according to the domain distribution below.

| Domain | Key Tasks | % of Scored Items | Approx. Scored Items* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Evaluate and analyze data to determine occupational needs | Build occupational profile, select assessments, analyze results | 25% | ~38 |
| 2. Formulate conclusions regarding client needs and priorities | Synthesize findings, establish goals, recommend service delivery | 23% | ~35 |
| 3. Select interventions for client-centered outcomes | Plan, implement, modify interventions; education; discharge planning | 37% | ~56 |
| 4. Manage and direct occupational therapy services | Supervision, program management, quality, ethics, advocacy | 15% | ~23 |

*Approximate counts are calculated from 150 scored items (NBCOT does not guarantee precise item counts but keeps weighted representation across forms).

## Implications for the Practice-Test Build

- **Task vs. Knowledge mix:** Domains 1-3 favor case-based items requiring interpretation of client data. Domain 4 includes policy/supervision scenarios.
- **Item styles:** NBCOT uses single-best-answer multiple choice, multi-select, and multi-step items. The current project can prioritize single-best questions first, then layer multi-select to mirror Domain 3 case vignettes.
- **Blueprint coverage:** Generated practice sets should ensure at least 55-60% of items are intervention-focused (Domain 3), with ~25% evaluation (Domain 1), ~23% reasoning and plan decisions (Domain 2), and 15% professional practice (Domain 4).
