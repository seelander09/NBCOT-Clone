An outpatient client had a recent dislocation of the proximal radius with a possible injury to the lateral collateral ligament. The client is referred to OT for fabrication of a posterior elbow
orthosis. The primary purpose of the orthosis is to immobilize the affected extremity during the acute phase of healing. How should the elbow joint and forearm be positioned in the
orthosis to achieve this goal?
© Full elbow extension with the forearm positioned in neutral rotation
© 20° of elbow flexion with forearm positioned in pronation
© Elbow in slight flexion with forearm positioned in supination
