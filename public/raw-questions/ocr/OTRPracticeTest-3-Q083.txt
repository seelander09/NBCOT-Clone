An OTR is completing a mealtime assessment of a client who has a progressive neurodegenerative disease. When self-feeding, the client has difficulty bringing both hands to midline |
to cut food. While keeping the head in midline to look at the food on the plate, the client is unable to bring either hand to the mouth. Which brainstem level reflex appears to be
interfering with the client's ability to self-feed?
