A client with a hemiplegic upper extremity is developing spasticity and is at risk for contracture development. The OTR is teaching the client and a caregiver how to complete a routine

stretching program. One of the objectives of the program is for the caregiver to assist the client to achieve terminal ROM for shoulder flexion while avoiding soft-tissue entrapment in

the subacromial space. What information about the shoulder complex MUST the OTR explain to the client and caregiver to meet this objective?
O Maintain external rotation of the glenohumeral joint and abduction of the humerus.
© Ensure the scapula is supported in a position of protraction and upward rotation.
O Facilitate adduction of the scapula and downward rotation while moving the arm
