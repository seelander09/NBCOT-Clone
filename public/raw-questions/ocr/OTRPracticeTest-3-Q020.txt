An OTR is working with a vocational rehabilitation team to make recommendations for a young adult client with autism spectrum disorder. The client recently started a supported
employment opportunity as a bagger at a grocery store. The client is independent in loading a customer's groceries into store-provided shopping bags; however, the client has
difficulty when the customer provides reusable bags. What action should the OTR take to support the client's job performance?
O Teach the client to consistently load the heavier items into the bag first, followed by the lighter items.
© Develop a visual strategy with pictures of groceries loaded into a variety of different types of bags.
© Have the client ask the customer to discuss preferred methods for loading the groceries into the reusable bag.
