An OTR is using the Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance (CO-OP) approach to guide intervention with a 7-year-old child who has developmental coordination disorder.
One of the child's goals is to be able to write a letter to a relative who lives in a different city. Currently, the child’s written work has poor legibility. Considering the KEY FEATURES of
the CO-OP model, which action should the OTR include in the intervention sessions?
