A patient in an intensive care unit is recovering from respiratory failure and was recently weaned from mechanical ventilation. At the start of an ADL session, the OTR observes the
patient's vital signs to be within normal limits when the patient is positioned in bed with the head of the bed raised to 30°. The OTR assists the patient to transfer from the bed to a
recliner chair and notes the patient's physiologic responses to this movement activity are as follows: heart rate = 122 beats per minute, blood pressure = 160 / 100 mmHg, oxygen
saturation = 93% and respiratory rate = 21 breaths per minute. What action should the OTR take NEXT based on these vital signs?
O Alert the patient's primary nurse and proceed with the planned session.
© Activate the emergency response system and discontinue the session.
CO Assist the patient to transfer from the chair back to bed and position in supine.
