A client with bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is no longer able to use finger movements to select letters and words on a direct-selection augmentative and alternative

communication (AAC) device. The interprofessional team provided the client with a new speech-generating AAC device that the client is able to access with eyebrow movements.

Despite being able to express basic needs, the client rarely uses the new device. What action is BEST for the OTR to take to enhance the client's ability to communicate?
O Research low-tech communication options for individuals who have the bulbar form of ALS.
O Offer to provide additional training to the caregiver on how to set up the new AAC device
© Screen the client for signs and symptoms of depression and satisfaction with quality of life.
