ventilation one day ago, and vital signs remain stable on room air. A general screening indicates the patient has Trace (1/5) strength in upper and lower extremities bilaterally. The
patient is participating in an OT session in bed with the head of the bed elevated to 85°. After 15 minutes, the patient's oxygen saturation level measured 82%. What action should the
OTR take in response to the patient's autonomic response?
O Provide a rest break for several minutes until the oxygen level stabilizes at or above 90%.
© Elevate the lower extremities, then continue the session while monitoring oxygen levels.
