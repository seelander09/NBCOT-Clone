An adult client who has schizoaffective disorder and is currently functioning at Allen Cognitive Level 5 (Exploratory Actions) lives in a group home. The client was able to operate the
push-button, top-loading washing machine in the group home to wash clothes independently. Recently, the machine was replaced by a front-opening machine with a dial setting. The
client has not adapted to the new machine and now relies on staff to complete the laundry. What INITIAL strategy should the OTR use to support the client's independence with
operating the new machine?
© Encourage a trial-and-error approach to help the client learn the new sequence.
© Have the client watch a web-based video of the operating procedures.
O Provide step-by-step illustrations that can be posted in the laundry room.
© Use meta-cognitive strategies to help the client learn each step of the task.
