An OTR is providing early intervention services to a 13-month-old child with Down syndrome who has delayed oral motor skill development. The child has hypotonicity and sits with
an open mouth posture. Currently, the child is dependent on a bottle for nutrition but is working toward transitioning to textured foods. During a mealtime session, the OTR observes
that the child uses an anterior-posterior tongue movement pattern resulting in food being pushed out of the mouth. What INITIAL intervention should the OTR recommend to the
parent to support progress toward the development of the child's feeding skills?
O Have the child use an angled spoon with a built-up handle and provide hand-over-hand assistance to facilitate a hand-to-mouth feeding pattern
© Prior to offering the child food, apply pressure on the middle of the tongue using a probe with a rectangular tip and support the child's lower jaw.
© Place the child in an adapted high chair with lateral trunk supports and have the parent sit beside the child when feeding textured foods.
