An OTR who works on an acute neurological unit is evaluating an inpatient at the bedside in the patient’s hospital room. As part of the evaluation process, the OTR asks the patient to
repeat a set of simple verbal instructions. Instead, the patient responds by repeating parts of a conversation that is occurring elsewhere in the room. What action is MOST BENEFICIAL
for the OTR to take when determining if the patient's response is due to selective attention?
© Move the patient to a quiet therapy space and repeat the instructions.
© Write the instructions on paper and ask the patient to read them out loud.
© Use step-by-step instructions while speaking with a louder voice volume.
