An outpatient client sustained a crush injury with a traumatic amputation of the middle finger just proximal to the DIP joint on the dominant hand 3 weeks ago. Medical records
indicate the client had surgery for an internal fixation of the phalanx, and tissue from the volar tip was used to close the opening in the skin on the dorsal surface. Currently, the sutures
have been removed and the finger has mild edema and erythema. There is a moderate amount of black eschar around the tip of the finger and some sanguineous drainage. The client
wants to return to work as a machinist. What INITIAL instructions should the OTR provide to the client to promote progress toward the return-to-work goal at this stage of wound
healing?
O Apply a topical antiseptic before and after active ROM exercises and self-care.
O Complete warm water soaks four times per day to remove eschar and promote drainage.
© Perform dressing changes as prescribed by the physician and monitor for signs of infection.
