An 18-month-old child has delayed play skills secondary to Down syndrome. At the start of intervention 6 months ago, the child's social play skills were at a 10-month-old level. After
providing the child opportunities with "just right" challenges while interacting with same-age peers, the child's play skills have improved and are now at a 16-month-old level. What
recommendations should the OTR include as part of a home program to promote carry-over of learned play skills?
© Recommend the child attend a play group to support ongoing interactions with other children.
O Borrow adapted toys from a developmental learning center that meet the child's current level of function.
© Engage the child in pretend play activities that incorporate objects the child prefers using
