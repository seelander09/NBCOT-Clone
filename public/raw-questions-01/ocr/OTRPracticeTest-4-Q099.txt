An OTR works in a community-based early childhood center providing services to children with global developmental delays. The director asks the OTR to develop an inservice for
teachers and classroom staff to provide strategies to support fine motor development in the pre-kindergarten classrooms. Based on the OTR's experience working at the center the
staff is showing signs of burnout due to staff shortages and the return to in-person learning. Staff have become overwhelmed when discussing additional classroom strategies with
the OTR during regular consultation sessions. What is the NEXT action the OTR should take in this situation?
O Provide a survey to the staff to determine their preferred inservice topic
O Develop a fine motor inservice with a plan to discuss the staff burnout if time permits
© Discuss with the director the need to address the staff burnout and fatigue that the OTR has observed
