A resident in a skilled nursing facility has early stage 3 Parkinson's disease. The resident was independent in self-feeding until experiencing a decline in function over the past week.

The resident wants to continue eating meals with other residents in the dining room but reports feeling too embarrassed due to the influence of symptoms on the ability to self-feed.

Which action would be MOST BENEFICIAL for the OTR to take as part of the initial intervention for enabling the resident to continue eating in the dining room?
© Recommend modifying food texture and transitioning the resident to a level 1 dysphagia diet.
O Provide the resident with lightweight eating utensils and a cup with bilateral handles to use at meals.
© Identify a seating arrangement that would facilitate postural and upper extremity stability during mealtime.
