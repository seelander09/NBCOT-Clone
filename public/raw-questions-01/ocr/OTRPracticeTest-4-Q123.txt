An OTR is evaluating a 5-year-old child who has a pervasive developmental delay. During ADL, the OTR observes that when the child is positioned in a supine position and the
caregiver turns the child's head to one side, the arm toward which the face is turned reflexively moves into extension while the opposite upper extremity moves into a flexed position
Which persistent primitive reflex is interfering with the child’s participation in these tasks?
