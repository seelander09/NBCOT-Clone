An OTR is revising the intervention plan for an adult client with autism who worked as a dishwasher at a nursing home with the support of a full-time job coach. The job coach was

decreased to part-time after the client demonstrated successful job performance. While working independently, the client had a verbal outburst and was fired from the position. Based

on this situation, what clinical reasoning should the OTR use when revising the intervention plan for this client?
© Understand that the job coach's reduction in hours was an appropriate risk and provide an opportunity to develop the client's self-determination.
O Appreciate that the client would benefit from a similar job placement in a different setting and plan for additional staff sensitivity training about disability awareness.
© Consider that the client's vocational success is contingent on contextual strategies and advocate for long-term, full-time support from a job coach
