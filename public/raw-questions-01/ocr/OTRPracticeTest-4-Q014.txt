An OTR is completing a feeding assessment of an inpatient who had a resection of a right hemispheric brain tumor 5 days ago. When self-feeding, the patient has good hand-to-

mouth patterns, manipulates utensils without difficulty, and uses an efficient swallow. However, the patient selects only foods that are positioned on the right side of the plate. Which

intervention should the OTR include in sessions to increase the patient's self-feeding skills?
O Provide the patient with options for using partial visual occlusion when eating
O Have the dining staff use the clock technique for positioning foods on the patient's plate.
