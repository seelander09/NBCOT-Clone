An OTR is scheduled to begin ADL sessions with a resident in a long term care facility who is ventilator-dependent and is deconditioned from prolonged bed rest. Nursing staff report
that over the past several days, the resident's systolic blood pressure has been dropping by 20 mm Hg when the resident moves from supine to sitting at the edge of the bed. How
should the OTR initially grade the ADL session based on this resident's response to this activity?
O Allow the systolic blood pressure to rise by 10 mm Hg after the resident sits upright at the edge of the bed.
© Have the resident begin simple ADL lying supine in bed with the head of the bed elevated to 45°.
CO Start the ADL session with the resident supine in bed and the head of the bed elevated to 90°.
