An OTR is working with an inpatient who has respiratory distress, altered consciousness and dysphagia. The patient's nutritional intake is provided through a nasogastric tube. The
priority for OT intervention at this time is positioning the patient to prevent bed sore injuries. Which precaution should the OTR take during intervention sessions to avoid complications
associated with the nasogastric tube?
© Roll the patient onto their right side and stabilize the patient with pillows before turning off the feeding pump.
© Ensure the head of the bed is elevated to a minimum of 30° during and immediately after feeding.
O Ask the primary care nurse to stop the feeding pump prior to and during intervention sessions.
