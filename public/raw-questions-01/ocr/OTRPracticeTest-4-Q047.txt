An OTR is fabricating an orthosis for a 9-year-old child who had an elbow capsulotomy and triceps lengthening procedure 2 days ago. The goal of the surgery was to increase the

child's ability to flex the elbow beyond 90° for greater independence during activities such as self-feeding and self-care of the face, teeth, and hair. What type of orthosis is indicated at

this stage of healing to support progress toward this goal?
© Dynamic extension orthosis to allow active elbow flexion and extension through a full arc of motion
O Long-arm thermoplastic immobilization orthosis to position the affected elbow in complete extension
© Elbow mobilization flexion restriction orthosis to allow controlled passive ROM from 0° extension to 90° flexion
