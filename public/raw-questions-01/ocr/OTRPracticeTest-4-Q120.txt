An OTR and an entry-level COTA are employed in an outpatient setting. Several clients on the OTR caseload are due for their recertification update as required by Medicare. The OTR

learns that these clients have been scheduled for reevaluation appointments on a day when the OTR must be on personal leave time and will be away from the facility. How should the

OTR respond to this finding?
O Ask the administrator to provide line-of-sight supervision while the COTA completes the scheduled evaluations.
© Request the appointment times be changed to a date before or soon after the scheduled leave time.
O Use progress notes from the clients’ previous sessions to update the plan of care prior to taking the scheduled leave.
