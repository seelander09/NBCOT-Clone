An OTR is reviewing the results of a randomized control trial that studied the effectiveness of facilitation techniques versus functional electrical stimulation (FES) for neuromuscular
reeducation in adults who have hemiplegia. Participants (n=38) had reduced independence in ADL and all participated in OT for 60 minutes 3 days per week for 16 weeks. Members of
the intervention group received facilitation techniques as a preparatory method prior to occupation-based activities whereas the control group received FES. Statistical results of the
pretest posttest ADL scores indicate p < 0.05 for the intervention group and p > 0.05 for the control group. Based on these study results, which action is BEST for the OTR to
incorporate into the intervention plan?
O Discontinue use of both FES and facilitation methods
© Incorporate facilitation methods into treatment sessions
© Incorporate FES in treatment sessions.
