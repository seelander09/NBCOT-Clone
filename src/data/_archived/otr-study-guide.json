To pass the exam, you must obtain a score equal to or higher than the minimum passing score. The minimum passing score represents an absolute standard and does not depend on the performance of other candidates taking the same exam. The minimum passing score for the certification exam is set by content experts using widely recognized standard setting methodologies. NBCOT uses a scaled scoring procedure to determine a candidate's final score. The scaled score is not a \"number correct\" or \"percent correct\" score. Raw scores are converted to scaled scores that represent equivalent levels of achievement regardless of test form. The passing score for the certification exam is set at 450, with the lowest possible score set at 300 and the highest possible score set at 600. Candidates receive credit for selecting the correct response option. There is no penalty for selecting an incorrect response. Chapter 4 After the Exam ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ Score Reports After you complete your exam, NBCOT will score it. Exam scores are released on a predetermined schedule indicated on the scoring calendar. You can access the scoring calendar and information about scoring dates on the NBCOT website. When your score is released, you can view it in your MyNBCOT account. ￼ ￼ ￼. If you pass the exam, you will receive a congratulatory letter that includes your exam score and an official NBCOT certificate and wallet card. Remember that by taking the exam, you have agreed not to share any information regarding the exam. 15 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination Score Transfer Completing the certification exam application is not the same as applying for state licensure. Sending a Score Transfer to a state regulatory board does not automatically initiate the process to obtain a license or permit to work in that state. NBCOT certification is independent and different from any state or jurisdiction's law/licensure. All jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have some form of regulation for occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants. Before a candidate begins practicing in any state or comparable jurisdiction, it is essential that all requirements for that jurisdiction are met. To practice without a license or permit is against the law. After the Exam ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 16 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination After the Exam Retaking the Exam Not every candidate who takes the certification exam will achieve a passing score. If a passing standard is not achieved, a feedback report will be provided that includes the overall score, domain-level performance information, and an explanation for interpreting the overall and domain-level performance. The information on the domain areas is provided for diagnostic purposes only. The feedback report also includes answers to frequently asked questions about the report and the preparation needed to retake the exam. While it is disappointing to receive notification about not passing the exam, it is essential to address the consequences of this occurrence. Not passing the certification exam may impact your plans to begin an occupational therapy job. If you do not pass the certification exam and are negotiating with an employer about an OTR position, you must inform your potential employer of your need to retake the certification exam. Additionally, you should contact state regulatory entities for specific information regarding temporary licenses. Preparing to Retake the Certification Exam There are various reasons a candidate might not pass the certification exam. Reflecting on potential reasons is an important first step in preparing to retake the exam. Reasons for not passing may include: Poor test-taking strategies Ineffective study habits Lack of preparation Test anxiety External stressors ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ Key Points Summary ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 17 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination After earning your initial NBCOT certification, you have earned the privilege to use the OTR certification mark. Your initial certification is current for four years. After your first renewal, you will move to a three-year renewal cycle. The certification renewal season occurs annually between January and March, regardless of the month you received your initial certification. Certification renewal is required to maintain active certification. ￼ Chapter 5 Certification Renewal Benefits of Certification Renewal Your certification as an OTR is highly valued by you, the public, and your employers. NBCOT is your lifelong partner as you continue to grow and develop as a certified professional. In 2021, NBCOT conducted a survey of certificants asking about the value of certification. Survey results demonstrated that both OTR and COTA certificants feel a strong sense of pride in their certification and value the sense of accomplishment that comes from having met a rigorous national standard. Your Certification Matters Ensures a consistent national standard for OT practice Has a code of conduct that benefits the profession Valuable to the OT profession Improves the reputation of OT professionals Helps reinforce that OT professionals are providing safe and effective care ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼￼ ￼ ￼ 18 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination Requirements for Certification Renewal Accrue requisite units in the four years between your initial certification date and the date you renew your certification. Abide by the NBCOT Practice Standards/Code of Conduct. Complete a certification renewal application. Submit the appropriate renewal application fee.￼ Certification Renewal ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ NBCOT Navigator® Competency Assessment Platform If you passed the certification exam and have maintained an Active in Good Standing certification status, another benefit of certification is that you will have access to the NBCOT Navigator® suite.￼ ￼ OTR Credential One of the benefits of certification is having the privilege to use the OTR certification mark. It is necessary to maintain an Active in Good Standing certification status to use the OTR credential. Fulfilling the certification renewal requirements entitles you to continue using the OTR credential. ￼ ￼￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ The NBCOT Navigator is a suite of online tools designed to help you assess your competency across all areas of occupational therapy. All tools were created based on current practice and evidence-based literature. You can complete the tools to earn competency assessment units (CAUs) toward renewal, develop your occupational therapy knowledge and skills, and stay current in your practice. 19 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination The tools are available, at no charge, to individuals currently certified as an OTR and can be accessed through your MyNBCOT account. Competency assessment units (CAUs) are awarded for successful completion of tools. You can accrue CAUs each renewal period by completing tools in the NBCOT Navigator suite to use toward your NBCOT certification renewal requirements. Certification Renewal ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼￼ NBCOT Navigator Tools There is a wide range of competency assessment tools available on the NBCOT Navigator for the OTR: case simulations, mini games, mini practice quizzes, OT Knowledge Library, and practice assessments. Case Simulations Case simulations bring OT practice to life with a focus on clinical reasoning. Each case simulation starts with an opening scene that provides background information about the scenario. This is followed by a series of modules that engage you in providing OT services to a virtual client. Modules may include the following activities: Client interviews and chart reviews Selection of appropriate screening and assessment tools Completion of evaluations Interpretation of assessment results Interprofessional team discussions Intervention planning Provision of intervention services Discharge planning 20 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination Mini Practice Quizzes Mini practice quizzes are short multiple-choice quizzes grounded in evidence-based literature that are designed to assess knowledge of contemporary OT practice.

Here are some tips you may want to try: Stick to your study plan. Try to avoid procrastination. Set specific goals for each study session. Start with your gaps in knowledge first. Break down large tasks into smaller pieces. Stay focused-don't get distracted. Take regular breaks and reward yourself. Critical Thinking Use critical thinking as you review information and apply it to practice-relevant situations. Critical thinking is a core skill for all successful occupational therapy practitioners. It is through critical thinking that the practitioner effectively completes the occupational therapy process. You can use your critical thinking skills to frame how you study for the certification exam. Define what you want to learn. When starting to review or study a topic, it is best to first define what you want to learn. For example, you may be familiar with the anatomical implications of ulnar nerve palsy but want to know more about how it impacts thumb mobility and the challenges this condition poses to a caregiver caring for a young child. You can use critical thinking to help you understand the perspective of this caregiver. Define your learning using simple questions, such as: How does the impairment affect the caregiver's ability to button the child's clothes? How might this impact the caregiver's ability to assist with bathing tasks? Are adaptations needed to help the caregiver open food packaging? Chapter 8 Study Habits Study Habits 32 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination Consider what you already know. Critical thinking will help you identify strengths and gaps in your knowledge. Tapping into your previous experiences from fieldwork, labs, case studies, and readings will give you a foundation upon which to build a personalized study plan based on your learning needs. ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ Identify resources. Critical thinking is about recognizing and using the resources available to you. For example, you can further your understanding of ulnar nerve palsy by: Reviewing your class notes Talking to an occupational therapy practitioner who has provided services to people with this condition Discussing with your peers about how this condition affects occupations Identifying possible short-term and long-term treatment goals from key textbooks Figure 8.1 Areas of learning to enhance your knowledge of ulnar nerve palsy Influence of ulnar nerve palsy on function Review your class notes Gain knowledge from textbooks Discuss with your peers Learn from an OT practitioner Study Habits 33 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination Challenge yourself and ask questions. Use your critical thinking skills to enhance your understanding and application of knowledge to various situations. For example: What interventions are beneficial and effective during the acute phase of a condition versus during the rehabilitation phase? Why would a client respond differently to the same intervention when it is applied in different practice settings? How would I measure outcomes for a student in the school setting versus an older adult in a home health setting? Organize the information you have gathered. Be sure to identify methods to organize information in a way that is meaningful to you. By way of introducing a new example, if you are learning about which cognitive-perceptual impairments may influence occupational performance in clients who have had a CVA, you could create a visual representation as depicted in Figure 8.2. Please note, this example is not meant to be an exhaustive list of potential impairments a person may experience; it is a representative sample to showcase this organizational method.

Take action steps to consider the application of your knowledge into clinical practice. For example, you could take each impairment identified in Figure 8.2 and consider how this could influence occupational performance. See Figure 8.3.

Advise the proctor of any problems or concerns you have regarding the test environment before beginning the exam. Exam Day Strategies Manage Your Time Make a plan for managing your exam time. You have 4 hours to take the exam. The exam has 180 items composed of three- and four-option single-response multiple-choice items and six-option multi-select scenario items. Exam Tutorial The tutorial occurs prior to the start of your exam. Your exam time does not begin until you have completed the tutorial. You can choose to skip the tutorial. Read the Instructions Be sure to read the instructions before answering each item. Exam Day 38 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination Stay Calm If you feel anxious during the exam, take some deep, slow breaths. Don't worry if other people in the room finish before you. You do not need to leave the room until you have used all of your allotted time. If you experience a technical problem during the exam, inform the test center proctor. Release Tension If you feel tension, stretch, drop your shoulders, open and close your fingers, or shift in your chair. After Your Exam Day Relax and treat yourself; you have completed the exam! Avoid reviewing your study materials. You have completed the exam, and it is too late to change your answers. Remember, it is against the NBCOT Candidate/Certificant Code of Conduct to discuss exam items with other candidates or to record exam information from memory. ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ Exam Day SECTION 3 Time to Practice 40 NBCOT® Study Guide for the OTR Certification Examination"
